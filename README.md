### **Intro**

Customize the color of whispers to your own desire based on context. All of this works clientsided. Nothing your client sends is changed.

#### Usage

1. Edit `settings.json` to colorize:
	* `me` - your whispers.
	* `friends` - your friends whispers.
	* `others` - other peoples whispers 
	* `particular` - name specific whispers.
	
**particular** target can be stated both with a **single string** or **array of strings**. You'll find examples inside if you have no idea what all of this means, just follow the syntax.

2. There's some commands below, most of them are just bloat.
